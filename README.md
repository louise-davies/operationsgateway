OperationsGateway - user interface for operational data

## Getting Started with Vite

This project uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

This will install all the project dependencies. Running `yarn install` at the top
level initialises all the packages, and you will be ready to start development in any of them!

### `yarn dev`

Runs the `dev` script, which runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Runs unit tests for all packages

### `yarn e2e`

Runs e2e tests for all packages

### `yarn lint`

Lints all packages

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.\

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [building for production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.

### `yarn preview`

Deploys a static version of the build from the `dist` directory to port 5001. Use `yarn preview:build` to build and preview it in SciGateway.

For development purposes, use `yarn preview:build:dev` to build in watch mode so that changes are built automatically.
